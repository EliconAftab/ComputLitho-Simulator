# ComputLitho-Simulator
ComputLitho is a Python + Flask-based web application that allows users to simulate and analyze aerial image formation from GDSII files ‚Äî a key step in photolithography. The tool enables the calculation of fragmentation and aerial intensity maps based on parameters such as wavelength, numerical aperture, and resist settings.
# Features
GDSII File Upload: Parse and process input GDSII layout files.

üî¨ Aerial Image Simulation: Simulate image intensity distribution based on exposure system parameters.

‚öôÔ∏è Custom Input Parameters: Choose wavelength (Œª), numerical aperture (NA), layer, and datatype.

üß© Fragmentation Engine: Break complex mask geometries into smaller regions for precise optical simulation.

üìä Intensity Visualization: Generate and export aerial image plots with simulated intensity distributions.

üñ•Ô∏è Web Interface: User-friendly Flask UI to run simulations and view results interactively.


# WHAT IS COMPUTATIONAL LITHOHGRAPHY
Lithography is the process of transferring patterns of geometric shapes in a mask to a thin layer of radiation-sensitive material (called resist) covering the surface of a semiconductor wafer.

# File Handling
Each layer of a GDS File represents a specific fabrication step or material in semiconductor manufacturing.
Each layer has its own datatype.
In a GDS file, the datatype is an additional identifier assigned to a shape within a layer, used to further classify shapes that belong to the same layer.
