# ComputLitho-Simulator
ComputLitho is a Python + Flask-based web application that allows users to simulate and analyze aerial image formation from GDSII files — a key step in photolithography. The tool enables the calculation of fragmentation and aerial intensity maps based on parameters such as wavelength, numerical aperture, and resist settings.
# Features
GDSII File Upload: Parse and process input GDSII layout files.

🔬 Aerial Image Simulation: Simulate image intensity distribution based on exposure system parameters.

⚙️ Custom Input Parameters: Choose wavelength (λ), numerical aperture (NA), layer, and datatype.

🧩 Fragmentation Engine: Break complex mask geometries into smaller regions for precise optical simulation.

📊 Intensity Visualization: Generate and export aerial image plots with simulated intensity distributions.

🖥️ Web Interface: User-friendly Flask UI to run simulations and view results interactively.
